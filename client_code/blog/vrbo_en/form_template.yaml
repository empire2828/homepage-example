        ### How you can also synchronize prices with Fewo-Direkt using Smoobu via PriceLabs

        &nbsp;
        Many Smoobu landlords are familiar with the problem: while portals such as Airbnb or Booking.com apply price changes directly via the Smoobu interface, Fewo-Direkt (HomeAway/VRBO) does not yet offer direct price synchronization with Smoobu. However, those who already manage their prices with PriceLabs can elegantly circumvent this obstacle.

        Pricelabs can simultaneously supply Smoobu with prices, as well as Fewo-Direkt. Fewo-Direkt will then continue to receive the calendar data via iCal connection from Smoobu as before, and additionally the prices from Pricelabs.

        &nbsp;
        **Here's how to do it:**

        &nbsp;
        #### 1. Connect Fewo-Direkt with PriceLabs
        A new additional account is created via the main menu of PriceLabs “Add/Reconnect Listings” – preferably with a username and password. Detailed instructions can be found in the official PriceLabs documentation:

        &nbsp;
        #### 2. Create the account as a child account in PriceLabs

        In order for the prices to be taken over from the parent account, the new account must be defined as a child account. Each account categorized as a child account costs only an additional $1 per month.

        &nbsp;
        #### 3. Set pricing offset
        Under Dynamic Pricing/Customizations per account, set your pricing offset for the new account, i.e., the price surcharge you want to apply to compensate for the commission.

        &nbsp;
        #### Conclusion
        Even without a direct pricing API between Smoobu and Fewo-Direkt, PriceLabs allows you to implement a fully automated solution. This means that the same dynamic pricing strategies you already use on Airbnb or Booking are also reflected on Fewo-Direkt – without any additional maintenance effort.
