              How to adjust?

              You will find in each screen at the top left a date selector. On the left side in blue it is defined which date you can change (stay date, reservation date, cancellation date etc.):

            Use rolling last 12 months (LTM) for vacation rental KPIs because it captures a full seasonal cycle and avoids distortions from peak/off-peak months; base comparisons on completed past months so indicators aren’t understated by bookings that are still to come.

            - Seasonality: LTM includes each month once, smoothing peaks and troughs for fair trend comparisons.

            - Completeness: Using only completed months prevents undercounting, since future and current months are still picking up bookings.

            - Booking behavior: Many stays book close to arrival; mid-month snapshots understate revenue, ADR, and occupancy until pickup completes.

            - Moving events: Shifting holidays and festivals skew single-month or YTD views; LTM neutralizes this timing noise.

            - Decision-useful: LTM stabilizes revenue, ADR, occupancy, and booking-window metrics for pricing, forecasting, and performance reviews.

              The only screen which uses same time last year comparison is the Monthly Outlook screen.

            Compare future months to same time last year (STLY) because it matches seasonality and the same days-before-arrival, so performance isn’t penalized for bookings that are still to come in the current year.

            Future months are incomplete; many reservations book late, so STLY aligns on-the-books pace at the same date each year.

            Don’t compare to last year’s final month totals; compare to last year’s position on the same date so “still-to-come” bookings are excluded in both baselines.

            This keeps holiday/event timing consistent and makes pricing and availability decisions more accurate.
